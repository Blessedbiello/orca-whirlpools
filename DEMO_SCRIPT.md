# Transfer Hook Trading Demo Script

## ðŸŽ¬ Video Demo Walkthrough (7 minutes)

### Opening (30 seconds)
*Show browser with application loaded*

**Narrator:** "Today I'm demonstrating the first comprehensive solution for trading Token-2022 assets with Transfer Hooks on Solana. This addresses a major gap in the DeFi ecosystem where no major AMMs currently support Transfer Hooks, limiting adoption of Token-2022 as a DeFi primitive."

*Pan across the application interface*

"Our solution extends Orca Whirlpools - the industry's most battle-tested AMM infrastructure - with a safe, automated Transfer Hook approval system."

---

### Part 1: Token Creation (1.5 minutes)
*Click on "Create Token" tab*

**Narrator:** "Let's start by creating a Token-2022 with a Transfer Hook. I'm going to create an NFT token with built-in royalty collection."

*Fill out form:*
- Name: "Creator Art Token"  
- Symbol: "ART"
- Supply: "10000"
- Description: "NFT collection with automatic royalty collection"

*Scroll to Transfer Hook section*

"Here's where the magic happens. We provide pre-built Transfer Hook templates for common use cases."

*Select "Royalty Collection" template*

"The royalty template automatically collects creator fees on every transfer. Notice the risk assessment - this shows 'Low Risk' because royalty hooks are well-understood and audited."

*Click "Create Token"*

"When I create the token, it's automatically deployed with the Transfer Hook extension and submitted to our registry for approval."

*Show success message*

"Token created! The Transfer Hook is now pending community review in our registry system."

---

### Part 2: Registry Dashboard (1.5 minutes)  
*Click on "Registry" tab*

**Narrator:** "The Transfer Hook Registry is the heart of our safety system. It provides automated risk assessment combined with community governance."

*Scroll through submissions list*

"Here we can see various Transfer Hook submissions. Each has a risk score from 0-100 calculated by our automated analysis."

*Point to different submissions*

"Green status means approved and ready for use. Yellow means under community review. Red means rejected for security reasons."

*Click on "Under Review" submission*

"For hooks under review, community members can vote. Let's cast an approval vote on this KYC compliance hook."

*Click "Approve" button*

"I'm voting to approve because this hook has clear documentation, the source code is publicly available, and it serves a legitimate compliance purpose."

*Show vote confirmation*

"Vote cast! Once enough community votes are collected and the review period ends, approved hooks automatically get TokenBadge approval, making them ready for pool creation."

---

### Part 3: Pool Creation (1.5 minutes)
*Click "Create Pool" tab*

**Narrator:** "Now let's create a liquidity pool with our Transfer Hook token. I'll create an ART/SOL pair."

*Search and select ART token*
*Select SOL as Token B*

"Notice the system detects that ART has a Transfer Hook and shows the approval status. The green checkmark indicates it's approved and safe to use."

*Set fee tier to 0.3%*
*Add initial liquidity: 1000 ART, 50 SOL*

"I'm adding 1,000 ART tokens and 50 SOL as initial liquidity. The system automatically calculates the price ratio."

*Click "Create Pool"*

"Pool creation includes all the necessary Transfer Hook account setup behind the scenes. Users don't need to worry about the complexity."

*Show success message*

"Perfect! Our ART/SOL pool is now live and ready for trading."

---

### Part 4: Trading Demo (1.5 minutes)
*Click "Trade" tab*

**Narrator:** "Now for the moment of truth - let's trade tokens with Transfer Hooks."

*Select ART/SOL pool*

"I'm selecting our newly created ART/SOL pool. Notice the 'Transfer Hook' indicator showing this pool involves tokens with active hooks."

*Enter swap amount: 100 ART*

"I'll swap 100 ART tokens for SOL. The system automatically calculates the output amount and shows the price impact."

*Point to Transfer Hook warning*

"The interface clearly indicates that Transfer Hook logic will be executed during this swap - in this case, royalty collection."

*Review swap details*

"Everything looks good. The trading fee is 0.3%, price impact is minimal, and we're ready to execute."

*Click "Swap"*

"Executing the swap... The system automatically includes all necessary Transfer Hook accounts and executes the hook logic seamlessly."

*Show success message*

"Success! The swap completed with automatic royalty collection. The creator received their fees, and I got my SOL - all in a single transaction."

### Part 5: Technical Highlights (1 minute)
*Navigate between different sections*

**Narrator:** "What makes this solution special? Three key innovations:"

*Show registry dashboard*

"First, automated safety. Our risk assessment algorithm analyzes Transfer Hook programs for security issues, while community governance ensures only safe hooks are approved."

*Show pool creation interface*  

"Second, seamless integration. We built on Orca's existing Token-2022 support, extending it with automated TokenBadge creation. No manual approval bottlenecks."

*Show trading interface*

"Third, transparent operation. Users always know when Transfer Hooks are active, what they do, and can trade with confidence."

*Show comprehensive interface*

"The entire flow - from token creation to trading - is handled in one unified interface. No jumping between multiple tools or protocols."

---

### Closing (30 seconds)
*Show the full application overview*

**Narrator:** "This solution removes the primary barrier to Token-2022 adoption in DeFi. Enterprises can deploy compliant tokens, creators can monetize through automated royalties, and traders can access new asset classes - all safely on proven infrastructure."

*Show GitHub repository*

"The complete source code is available on GitHub, including the smart contracts, frontend application, and comprehensive documentation."

*End on the main interface*

"Token-2022 with Transfer Hooks is now ready for prime time in Solana DeFi. The future of programmable tokens starts today."
