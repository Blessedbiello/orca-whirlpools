# Token-2022 Transfer Hook Trading Solution

## 🏆 **Bounty Challenge Completed**

> **"Build a working solution that makes Token-2022 with Transfer Hooks tradable on a Solana AMM"**

This project delivers a **complete, production-ready solution** that enables Token-2022 assets with Transfer Hooks to be safely created, approved, and traded on Orca Whirlpools - addressing the major gap preventing Token-2022 adoption in DeFi.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Problem**: No major AMMs (Raydium, Orca, Meteora) currently support trading Token-2022 with active Transfer Hooks, limiting adoption of Token-2022 as a DeFi primitive.

**Our Solution**: Extend Orca Whirlpools with an automated Transfer Hook registry and approval system that maintains security while enabling permissionless trading.

### 🔍 Key Discovery

**Orca Whirlpools already supports Transfer Hooks!** The V2 instruction set has complete Token-2022 Transfer Hook support, but requires manual TokenBadge approval for security. Our solution eliminates this friction while maintaining safety.

## 🏗️ Solution Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Transfer Hook Registry Program** (`/programs/transfer-hook-registry/`)
   - Smart contract for automated risk assessment
   - Community governance voting system
   - Automated TokenBadge approval for approved hooks

2. **Enhanced UI** (`/frontend/`)
   - Token-2022 creation with Transfer Hook integration
   - Pool creation and management interface
   - Registry dashboard with governance features
   - Seamless trading interface

3. **SDK Integration** (extends existing Orca SDKs)
   - Automatic Transfer Hook account resolution
   - Registry integration helpers
   - Enhanced error handling and validation

## 🚀 Features

### ✅ Token Creation
- Create Token-2022 with pre-built Transfer Hook templates
- Royalty collection hooks for NFTs and tokens
- KYC/AML compliance hooks for regulated assets
- Custom logging hooks for analytics
- Automated submission to registry

### ✅ Safety & Security
- Automated risk assessment with scoring (0-100)
- Community governance voting system
- Multi-tier approval process (automated + manual)
- Integration with existing Orca security measures

### ✅ Trading Experience
- Seamless swapping with Transfer Hook execution
- Real-time hook status validation
- Clear indicators for Transfer Hook tokens
- Automatic account resolution for hooks

### ✅ Registry Management
- Public registry of approved Transfer Hooks
- Risk scores and community ratings
- Governance voting interface
- TokenBadge automation

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Transfer Hook Registry Program

**State Accounts:**
- `RegistryConfig`: Global registry configuration
- `HookSubmission`: Individual Transfer Hook submissions
- `RiskAssessment`: Automated risk analysis results
- `GovernanceVote`: Community voting records

**Key Instructions:**
- `initialize_registry`: Set up the registry system
- `submit_hook_for_approval`: Submit new Transfer Hook for review
- `assess_hook_risk`: Automated risk assessment
- `cast_governance_vote`: Community voting
- `finalize_hook_approval`: Complete the approval process
- `auto_approve_token_badge`: Automatically create TokenBadge for approved hooks

### Risk Assessment Algorithm

The system evaluates Transfer Hooks across multiple dimensions:

```rust
pub struct RiskFlags {
    pub has_upgrade_authority: bool,      // +15 risk
    pub performs_token_transfers: bool,   // +25 risk
    pub can_block_transfers: bool,        // +20 risk
    pub requests_many_accounts: bool,     // +10 risk
    pub is_verified_build: bool,         // -15 risk
    pub is_audited: bool,                // -20 risk
    pub source_code_available: bool,     // -10 risk
    pub follows_best_practices: bool,    // -10 risk
}
```

**Risk Levels:**
- **Low Risk (0-30)**: Automated approval possible
- **Medium Risk (31-60)**: Manual review recommended
- **High Risk (61-100)**: Requires extensive community review

### Frontend Architecture

Built with **Next.js 14** and **TypeScript**, featuring:

- **Wallet Integration**: Seamless Solana wallet connection
- **Real-time Updates**: Live status updates for submissions
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS
- **Component Library**: Reusable UI components with accessibility
